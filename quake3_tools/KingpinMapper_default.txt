// KingpinMapper configuration by hypov8
//
// KingpinMapper.exe can be located in any folder
// make sure this file exists in a sub folder to KingpinMapper.exe
//
// version 3
//==========
// the below settings will be used when GUI is set to 'default' compile
// 'custom' will be generated based of these but stored in a seperate file. thus allowing 2 'profiles'
//
//
//==============================
// newcolum (start a new colum)
// switch_APPENDMAP, (append map name to end. not all programs suport this, some use a switch instead) (requires 1 comma)
// switch_CHECK_BOX, <display name>, <compile switch>, <checked(0/1/2)>, <tooltip>, <tip n..>
// switch_TEXT_BOX_, <display name>, <compile switch>, <checked(0/1/2)>, <default text>, <tooltip>, <tip n..>
// note: checked=2 is greyed out
//
//==============================
// for options below use eg..
// switch_PATH_EXE_, <display name>, <compile switch>, <checked(0/1)>, <default text>, <pathname(0/1/2)>, <tooltip>, <tip n..>
// Note: <pathname(0/1/2)> 0=folder, 1=folder/filename, 2=folder/text
//================================
// switch_PATH_EXE_ //insert kingpin.exe folder/file after switch
// switch_PATH_BASE //insert /main folder after switch      	//note: <pathname(1)> dont work
// switch_PATH_MOD_ //insert /mod folder  after switch       	//note: <pathname(1)> dont work
